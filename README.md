# Data-Mining-Machine-Learning-Neural-Networks
This repository contains various university related projects that I have done throughout my time at Copenhagen Business School.

ML MA 01:
This is mandatory assignment no. 1 containing: a dataset about forest fires in Spain. The notebook attempts to predict the area of potential forest fires based upon certain features. It uses supervised machine learning in the form of multivariate regression analysis. A decision tree is then built.

ML MA 02:
This is mandatory assignment no. 2 containing: EDA, pre-processing, SMOTE, Classification (Grid Search, KNN and SVM, performancce metrics), Ensemble Learning (Decision Tree, Voting Classifier), Random Forest, Clustering (Agglomerative Clustering, K-Means Clustering).

ML MA 03:
This is mandatory assignment no. 3 containing: a simple handmade implementation of a Naive Bayes Document Classifier with data loading, feature exploration, fit method, predict method and implementation.
